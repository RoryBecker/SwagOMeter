# Swagometer

The Swagometer was started back in 2008 when I needed a way of distiburting our door prizes at [NxtGenUG Southampton](http://www.nxtgenug.net/Southampton).  It was my very first WPF app, and as such was incredibly hacky and full of starting out mistakes.  I've had a few requests from people to see the code I hacked together, so I've spent a little time cleaning it up.  It still needs some love, but it's generally in good shape.

The Icon and Logo should be replaced with your own bits and bobs.  You need to put a MP3 file called "Music.mp3" in the Resources folder, this will be used by the play button.

## Known issues

At the moment it will tell you that no Attendee or Swag location has been set on initial start up twice, until one is provided.
